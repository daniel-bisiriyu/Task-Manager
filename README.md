# Task-Manager
Productivity tool developed by Starthub interns.

This is the official repository that is in development by a team of interns at Start Innovation Hub, Uyo, Nigeria. 

To contribute to this repo if you have been made a contributor, first clone the repo by running the command:

```git clone https://github.com/olaleye247/Task-Manager```

This would create a local copy of the repo on your local machine. Now that you have the repo, you should first create a branch
before making any changes. You create a branch by running the following command:

```git branch branch-name ```

branch-name will be the name of your branch.

Now you can make all the changes you need to and add any new feature.
It is best practice to make commits at every landmark point in your code.
